# JMOD Collection

Sometimes you don't want vast mods changing the complete layout of the game.  Perhaps you want something simpler, closer to home.  Maybe just adding more metals which can cooperate with mods you do have.  Or maybe an early-game alloying and ore-doubling mechanic that doesn't require building some complicated machinery or a power source other than a good ol' piece of coal.

Or maybe you want to use some kind of dye flowers, but you don't want the white ones to unbalance your game.  Maybe you want your Ztones to work with the chisel, _and_ you want an option to undo what you chiseled the blocks into.

These are just a couple of examples of what is possible with JMOD:[The JavaScript Mod Loader](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jmod-the-javascript-mod-loader).

Feel free to use these scripts to your heart's content!  If you want to change anything, simply edit the "main.js" file in the jmod file (it's just a common zip) to make your tweaks.  

And remember, you need [JMOD](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/jmod-the-javascript-mod-loader) to use these mods!
